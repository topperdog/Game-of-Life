# Game-of-Life
Spring 2015 project.
This is the final version turned in for grade for 2015 Capstone project.  I uploaded this directly from visual studio.  I cloned the Master Branch from Visual Studio 2012, so I commited to the master branch testing how to do a commit straight fom Visual Studio 2012.  Added *.opensdf to the gitignore file.
